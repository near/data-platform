Near.org Data Platform Initiatives and Epics: Recommendations, Search, Analaytics

## How to use GitHub

- Roadmap: https://github.com/orgs/near/projects/80/views/3?sliceBy%5Bvalue%5D=Data+Platform
- QueryAPI tickets in queryapi repo
- General Data platform epics and tickets are data-platform repo

## Communication:
- All ticket-related communication should be in issues

## Data Platform Initiatives
- Should have clear title that could be understood by anyone in the ecosystem
- Should have Data Platform team assigned
- Should have a description with high-level functionality, without technical details
- Should have at least one epic in the relevant team’s repository that implements it
- Should have defined Priority and Impact

## For every new GitHub issue, make sure:
- To add it to the Data Platform project
- Make sure it’s connected to a relevant Epic
- Consider adding an appropriate level: `bug`, `indexer`
- If you are not sure who will work on this issue, don’t assign anyone.

## For every GitHub issue:
- If issue involves writing code, start a draft PR as soon as possible, so that the team can see the progress
- Connect it to a relevant Pull Request. If PR-linking functionality doesn’t work, drop PR link to a comment

## For every Epic:
- Epics should fit in one quarter by complexity
- The title of an epic should describe the end-user value. If this is not possible (i.e. the epic is about refactoring), consider moving sub-issues to other epics that have appropriate title.
- make sure that Epic is connected to the Pagoda Initiative in the Pagoda Public Roadmap
- consider adding a milestone to this issue. The milestone is some public announcement, conference, a sunset of a functionality or some other important external event.
